km-itunes-update-apps - a Keyboard Maestro macro to update iOS apps using iTunes
=====================

For years, iTunes has been able to update podcasts using AppleScript:

	tell application "iTunes"
		activate
		updateAllPodcasts
	end tell

but there's no comparable way to update your iOS apps.

Until now.

[iTunes-Update-Apps.kmmacros] is a [Keyboard Maestro] macro designed to do just that.

Here's what it looks like, and then I'll explain what each step does:
